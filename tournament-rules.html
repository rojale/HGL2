					<p>When a player wins a game, the class used by the winning player cannot be use for the remainder of the match.</p>
					<p>The losing player can keep the same class or choose to change to their other class.</p>
					<p>Players will be told what classes their opponent has available, but they won't know which class is picked until both players have picked.</p>
					<p>Players may edit their decks at any point in the tournament as long as they DO NOT leave the challenge.</p>
					<p>Players can only have 1 deck prepared for each of their 3 chosen classes. (You can ask your opponent for a screenshot of their deckslots WITHIN the challenge.)</p>
					<p>Matches will be played in a best of 3 format. The first player to win 2 games is considered the winner of the match and advances.</p>
